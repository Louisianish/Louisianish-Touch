        <p>
            During my 5 years in the web and mobile app development profession, I've had the privilege of working closely with clients in various industries throughout the state of Louisiana and greater Gulf South. In many cases, clients have expressed that one of the major challenges they face when it comes to their websites and mobile apps is figuring out how to best showcase their passion and brand identity to potential customers in a way that helps inspire them to look into, fall in love with, and identify with their product, thus creating brand loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many businesses are exceptional at conveying their passion for their product or service once the customer walks through the doors of their establishment, but getting potential customers through the door in the first place can sometimes be more difficult than it seems, because in many cases, potential users of your product or service may have had a handful of encounters with your business long before they step foot on your property. Their attitude walking into your business may depend on the experiences they've had with your online services, which can range from excellent to disastrous. Often, the negative experiences are simply a matter of a poorly functioning online ordering system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether the issue you struggle with is showcasing your brand identity to your online audience and inspiring brand loyalty or creating an exceptional online user experience for your customers, let me use my skills in web design and mobile app development combined with my over 15 years of experience working for some of the leading companies in customer and guest service in the industries of retail, hospitality, and tourism to help you build something spectacular!
